Tasks:

Port Scanner:
● Port scanning is a method of determining which ports on a network are open and could be
receiving or sending data. It is also a process for sending packets to specific ports on a
host and analyzing responses to identify vulnerabilities. This scanning can’t take place
without first identifying a list of active hosts and mapping those hosts to their IP
addresses. This activity, called host discovery, starts by doing a network scan.

Subdomain Scanner:
● Subdomain enumeration is the process of finding valid (resolvable) subdomains for one
or more domain(s). Unless the DNS server exposes a full DNS zone, it is really hard to
obtain a list of existing subdomains.
● We are collecting the subdomains from the crt.sh, which means we are getting the valid
and working subdomains.
● Source of subdomains: https://crt.sh/

URL Extractor:
● This tool supports extraction of URLs, Meta Tags and Images from a web page. The
extracted web addresses are displayed in a simple list. URL is also known as Uniform
Resource Locator. This tool will extricate all the meta tags of the webpage and Lists them
with the information.
